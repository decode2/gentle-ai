	// j81's RC-created repair fixture (#2839) follows the independently-owned
	// #2621 journey. j85 proves #1956's START and FINALIZE parser refusals are preflight.
	// j82 proves #2127's reviewed full candidate can publish an unpublished
	// monotonic subset without reopening review.
	// j83 proves #2127's pre-PR path binds its candidate to the unique merge-base
	// while the advertised main ref remains a moving publication boundary. j87
	// proves #2871's correction binds the immutable failure across a later interrupt;
	// j88 proves #2843's unborn STATUS collects explicit untracked intent first;
	// j89 proves #2758 never offers a workspace receipt for a different index;
	// j90 proves #2016 resumes an explicit frozen reviewing lineage after workspace drift;
	// j91 proves #1800's pre-plan exit is audited abandon;
	// j92 proves #2879 quarantines released historical bytes without compatibility loading;
	// j93 proves #2822 classifies stale managed assets before START can persist;
	// j94 proves #2031 executes recovery when escalated target scope changes;
	// j95 proves #2945 corrected-tree inspection.
	// j99 proves #2906 classifies missing FINALIZE contract flags before mutation.
	// j101 proves #3065 collects an unrepresentable default workspace-overlay
	// selector before authorization and preserves the staged predecessor.
	// #1993 REMOVED two: j38 (the bound-passing-finish refusal routing to the
	// review router) and j39 (the stranded-successor exit it named). Review
	// acts after implementation and verification, so that refusal is gone and
	// both journeys had no subject left. j37 survives, rewritten to prove the
	// opposite of what it used to: the bound passing finish now CLOSES over a
	// corrected candidate and keeps the binding recorded.
	// j98 proves #2696 discovers a committed flat-root spec through both public
	// SDD status surfaces and preserves the same routing state.
	//
	// j96 proves #2891 blocks an off-path sibling in a nested same-repository workspace.
	// Bump this deliberately when a journey is added OR removed, and name it
	// here: the count exists so a journey cannot appear or vanish unnoticed.
